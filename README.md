# NutriClass-Food-Classification-Using-Nutritional-Data
In the era of increasing dietary awareness, the ability to classify food items based on nutritional attributes are invaluable. This project involves developing a machine learning model that classifies food into multiple categories using tabular data such as calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and sugar. By the end of this project,  we will be able to create a robust classification system that can accurately label food types and gain insights into what makes each food category distinct. management systems.
Hereâ€™s your **Approach** rewritten in a concise, README-friendly format:

---

### **Approach**

1. **Data Understanding & Exploration**

   * Load the food tabular dataset and inspect class distribution.
   * Visualize sample rows to observe inter-class variations.
   * Check dataset size, imbalance, and noise levels.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values (imputation or row removal).
   * Detect and remove/cap outliers.
   * Remove duplicate entries.
   * Normalize or standardize numerical features.

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Apply PCA or feature selection for dimensionality reduction.
   * Encode class labels (Label Encoding / One-Hot Encoding).

4. **Model Selection & Training**

   * Train and compare multiple classifiers:

     * Logistic Regression
     * Decision Tree
     * Random Forest
     * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
     * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
     * XGBoost
     * Gradient Boosting Classifier

If you want, I can also make a **shorter version under 350 characters** for your README summary section so it looks neat.
